After contract deployment in etherum black window you will get contract address under BudgetContract section and that contract
you replace in BlockchainBudgetBudgetApp/views.py python file

in BlockchainBudget/BudgetApp/views.py file you can see contract address like ''0xd374Cb05bd6187D6cF905D7bBD85f2b704fBDD29' 
this at line no 23 and 43 and just replace this with new contract address
